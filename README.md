Update: April 27, 2026.

Hi there! I'm Farza, the guy that made Clicky.

The existing codebase remains open source. Tinker with it, make it yours, start a company out of it, do whatever you want I don't mind. But, for all the new stuff I'm hacking on, gonna keep it private. To get the latest Clicky, you can go [here](https://www.heyclicky.com/).

I also tweeted about this [here](https://x.com/FarzaTV/status/2043402737828962489).

Go crazy with this repo!! It's an MIT license.

# Hi, this is Clicky.
It's an AI teacher that lives as a buddy next to your cursor. It can see your screen, talk to you, and even point at stuff. Kinda like having a real teacher next to you.

Download it [here](https://www.clicky.so/) for free.

Here's the [original tweet](https://x.com/FarzaTV/status/2041314633978659092) that kinda blew up for a demo for more context.

This is the open-source version of Clicky for those that want to hack on it, build their own features, or just see how it works under the hood.

## Get started with Claude Code

The fastest way to get this running is with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

Once you get Claude running, paste this:

```
Hi Claude.

Clone https://github.com/farzaa/clicky.git into my current directory.

Then read the CLAUDE.md. I want to get Clicky running locally on my Mac.

Help me set up everything — the Cloudflare Worker with my own API keys, the proxy URLs, and getting it building in Xcode. Walk me through it.
```

That's it. It'll clone the repo, read the docs, and walk you through the whole setup. Once you're running you can just keep talking to it — build features, fix bugs, whatever. Go crazy.

## Run it on your Claude Code login (no API keys, no server)

This fork answers with the Claude Code CLI on your Mac, so it uses whatever Claude plan you're signed into Claude Code with. There's nothing else to start: the app runs `claude` itself for answers and background tasks, listens with Apple Speech and speaks with your Mac's system voice (`say`, often a Siri voice).

1. Install and sign in to [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (`claude auth status` should say you're logged in). The app's setup window can do both for you.
2. Open `leanring-buddy.xcodeproj` and hit **Cmd + R**.
3. On first launch a setup window walks you through connecting Claude Code, the four permissions, and saying hi once. Open it again any time from the menu bar panel.

The menu bar panel has the settings: model (Haiku, Sonnet or Opus), "Think before answering" (off by default; it can add many seconds before Clicky starts talking) and open at login.

What this fork adds on top of the original Clicky:

- **Drawing on your screen**: Clicky circles, boxes, underlines, highlights, crosses out and writes short notes right on top of your apps, with its cursor as the pen, in time with what it's saying.
- **Guided steps**: ask how to do something and Clicky marks the one thing to click next. Click it and Clicky looks again and shows the next step, until you're done.
- **Faster voice**: Clicky starts talking as soon as the first sentence of the answer is ready.
- **Background tasks**: ask it to go research something or make a file ("make me a one page PDF comparing…") and a separate Claude Code session does it in the background; it's listed in the menu bar panel and Clicky tells you when it's done. Its shell commands are sandboxed to its own folder.
- **Dictation anywhere**: hold **fn+Control**, talk, let go, and the text is typed wherever your cursor is.
- **Circle it yourself**: while holding Control+Option, drag the mouse to draw on the screen; Clicky sees what you marked.

`local-bridge/server.mjs` is still here for testing (run it on another port and launch the app with `CLICKY_BRIDGE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8790`) and for ElevenLabs voices. The original Cloudflare Worker setup below still works the same way, through `CLICKY_BRIDGE_URL`.

## Manual setup

If you want to do it yourself, here's the deal.

### Prerequisites

- macOS 14.2+ (for ScreenCaptureKit)
- Xcode 15+
- Node.js 18+ (for the Cloudflare Worker)
- A [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) account (free tier works)
- API keys for: [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com), [AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com), [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io)

### 1. Set up the Cloudflare Worker

The Worker is a tiny proxy that holds your API keys. The app talks to the Worker, the Worker talks to the APIs. This way your keys never ship in the app binary.

```bash
cd worker
npm install
```

Now add your secrets. Wrangler will prompt you to paste each one:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY
npx wrangler secret put ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
```

For the ElevenLabs voice ID, open `wrangler.toml` and set it there (it's not sensitive):

```toml
[vars]
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID = "your-voice-id-here"
```

Deploy it:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

It'll give you a URL like `https://your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev`. Copy that.

### 2. Run the Worker locally (for development)

If you want to test changes to the Worker without deploying:

```bash
cd worker
npx wrangler dev
```

This starts a local server (usually `http://localhost:8787`) that behaves exactly like the deployed Worker. You'll need to create a `.dev.vars` file in the `worker/` directory with your keys:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=...
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=...
```

Then update the proxy URLs in the Swift code to point to `http://localhost:8787` instead of the deployed Worker URL while developing. Grep for `clicky-proxy` to find them all.

### 3. Update the proxy URLs in the app

The app has the Worker URL hardcoded in a few places. Search for `your-worker-name.your-subdomain.workers.dev` and replace it with your Worker URL:

```bash
grep -r "clicky-proxy" leanring-buddy/
```

You'll find it in:
- `CompanionManager.swift` — Claude chat + ElevenLabs TTS
- `AssemblyAIStreamingTranscriptionProvider.swift` — AssemblyAI token endpoint

### 4. Open in Xcode and run

```bash
open leanring-buddy.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:
1. Select the `leanring-buddy` scheme (yes, the typo is intentional, long story)
2. Set your signing team under Signing & Capabilities
3. Hit **Cmd + R** to build and run

The app will appear in your menu bar (not the dock). Click the icon to open the panel, grant the permissions it asks for, and you're good.

### Permissions the app needs

- **Microphone** — for push-to-talk voice capture
- **Accessibility** — for the global keyboard shortcut (Control + Option)
- **Screen Recording** — for taking screenshots when you use the hotkey
- **Screen Content** — for ScreenCaptureKit access

## Architecture

If you want the full technical breakdown, read `CLAUDE.md`. But here's the short version:

**Menu bar app** (no dock icon) with two `NSPanel` windows — one for the control panel dropdown, one for the full-screen transparent cursor overlay. Push-to-talk streams audio over a websocket to AssemblyAI, sends the transcript + screenshot to Claude via streaming SSE, and plays the response through ElevenLabs TTS. Claude can embed `[POINT:x,y:label:screenN]` tags in its responses to make the cursor fly to specific UI elements across multiple monitors. All three APIs are proxied through a Cloudflare Worker.

## Project structure

```

  ElevenLabsTTSClient.swift # Text-to-speech playback
  OverlayWindow.swift       # Blue cursor overlay
  AssemblyAI*.swift         # Real-time transcription
  BuddyDictation*.swift     # Push-to-talk pipeline
worker/                  # Cloudflare Worker proxy
  src/index.ts              # Three routes: /chat, /tts, /transcribe-token

```

## Contributing

PRs welcome. If you're using Claude Code, it already knows the codebase — just tell it what you want to build and point it at `CLAUDE.md`.
